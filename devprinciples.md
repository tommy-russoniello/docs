# Monstercat Development Principles

1. Don't depend on polish happening later; always maintain production capable code. Take more time to ensure quality.
2. Projects should always be in a runnable state and should easily be ran by your team. Ensure project builds are simple, deployable, and easy to run.
3. Never ignore errors unless it is the intended effect. Account for errors by providing defaults or presenting appropriate output.
4. Ensure your code is simple; continually think about how you can further simplify and abstract your code.
5. Spend the time to build great tools to help you make your project better.
6. You are your own best tester; never allow anyone else to experience bugs from your code or seethe product crash. Test thoroughly before committing your code so you do not waste others' time.
7. Once you see a bug, stop working and fix it. Stability and reliability are not built on a broken foundation.
8. Ensure your code is optimized and effective, it should be able to run in multiple environments without fail.
9. Write your code for this project only – not a future project. "You will be writing new code later because you will be smarter."
10. Save time and minimize mistakes by encapsulating functionality and ensuring consistency.
11. Code transparently; tell your team how you will tackle a problem to gain feedback and advice. Do not treat sections of a project like black boxes, all aspects of a project should be well understood and documented.
12. Programming is an art form, everyone is different and will produce different code. The end product is what matters.
