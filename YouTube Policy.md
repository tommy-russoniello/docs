# YouTube Policy

    October 6, 2016. Revision 1.2.1

>MONSTERCAT WILL NOT STRIKE A VIDEO USING OUR PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MUSIC
>
>*In the following cases, we will block a video worldwide:  
>(This is not a Strike and will not affect your channel in any way)*  
>
> - The video is posted before the release is posted to the [Official Monstercat Channel](http://www.youtube.com/Monstercat). 
> - The video includes filesharing links.
> - The video includes edited original music (ie. Bass Boosted - This is not how the artists intended for their music to be heard. Please respect that.)
>
>We ask that all music used in a video be credited in the video description using the following format:

>Title: `song name` by `artist name`  
>iTunes Download Link: `iTunes link to song`  
>Listen on Spotify: `Spotify link to song`  
>Video Link: `YouTube link to song`  

>A Content ID claim will automatically be applied to videos using our music. This guarantees that the original musician fairly receives a percentage of the advertising earnings of the claimed videos.

>Some people have been counter-claiming these automated claims. If you do not have a license then we ask that you do not counter-claim. We will have to hand out a strike if a claim is counter-claimed repeatedly. This is only fair to the original artists.


## Using Monstercat Music in Your Videos

**Option 1:**  
Content creators can purchase a whitelist license from https://www.monstercat.com/licensing/content-creators. This includes the addition of your channel to our whitelist, protecting your channel from any Content ID claims. You can 100% monetize your content on YouTube, Twitch, and Beam with a Monstercat whitelist license.

**Option 2:**  
Content creators can continue to use Monstercat music that has been purchased from approved stores without a Monstercat license, and those videos will receive Content ID claims as described in our policy.

**Option 3:**  
Content creators can apply to join the Monstercat Partner Program where they will receive a complementary Monstercat license at zero cost. This program is extremely limited and only open to highly influential content creators. Apply here: http://bit.ly/LicensingRequest
