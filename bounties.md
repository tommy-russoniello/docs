# Monstercat Bounty Program

This program rewards developers for contributing to our public software
development projects.

## How It Works

### Finding Bounties
Any projects we host publicly on GitHub that have issues with the label are eligible to be collected 
upon. The reward for the bounty will be included in the issue's description.

[View All monstercat.com Bounties](https://github.com/monstercat/deon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abounty)

### Submitting Bounties
To initiate collection of a bounty you must submit a pull request referencing
the bounty issue you are collecting. Upon approval and merging into the source
code you are eligible for the reward. Multiple pull requests can be active for
the same issue; it is up to you to make sure your pull request is easy to review
and merge.

### Collecting Payment
Bounty rewards will be sent through PayPal in USD. To claim your bounty after gaining
eligibility for the reward please send us an email to [bounties@monstercat.com](mailto:bounties@monstercat.com) with your PayPal information
using the same email you used to create your git commits.

Payment will only be sent to the person who submits a pull request. If you are working as a team it us up to that person to distribute the funds to their team.

You will also be eligible to receive the "Bounty Hunter" role on our Discord
server upon bounty claim and Discord identification proof.

## Developer Community

Join the [#bounty-hunters channel on our Discord](https://discord.gg/RAx5zTU) to chat with
other developers from the Monstercat community.

## Software Ownership

Any code merged into the projects main repositories will be owned by Monstercat.

## Writing Guide

All written scripts should follow [our JS Guide](https://github.com/monstercat/docs/blob/master/js-guide.md).

Any new software written should not break existing tests and should have
equivalent tests written for new functionality or missing uses cases that are
being fixed.

that person to distribute the payment to their team members.
